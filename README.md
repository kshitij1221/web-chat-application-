 Real-Time Web Chat Application üí¨

Welcome to the **Real-Time Web Chat Application**! This project demonstrates my understanding of **Flask, Python, and WebSockets** by enabling users to chat in real-time through a clean, user-friendly web interface. The focus of this project is to **learn backend development** using Flask and SocketIO while showcasing my ability to build scalable, real-world applications.

üöÄ Project Overview  

The Real-Time Web Chat Application enables users to:  
- Chat in real-time** with individual users and in groups using Flask-SocketIO.  
- Upload files** and exchange them within chat rooms.  
- Invite users** through email using an SMTP server.  
- Secure chat access** with authentication and authorization.  
- Manage individual/group chats** through custom chat rooms.  
- Audio calling integration** using the Twilio API.  

This project reflects my ability to build practical applications using Python and provides a foundation for developing more complex real-time applications in the future.

 üéØ Goals of the Project

1. Learn and practice:
   - Flask for backend development  
   - Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket-based real-time communication  
   - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend  
   - Authentication, authorization, and secure data storage with **MongoDB**  

2. Professional showcase:
   This project aims to catch the attention of **recruiters and companies**, demonstrating:
   - Hands-on experience with **sockets and real-time systems**  
   - Practical knowledge of **backend development** using Flask  
   - Problem-solving skills applied in building web-based applications  
   - Ability to integrate **APIs** and third-party tools like Twilio  

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Backend: Flask, Flask-SocketIO  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Database: MongoDB  
- APIs: SMTP for email invitations, Twilio API for audio calling  
- Version Control: Git  

üì¶ Project Setup
 Step 1: Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-application.git
cd chat-application
```

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment  
Use one of the following methods:  
- Command Line: 
  ```bash
  python -m venv env
  ```
-VS Code:
  Press **Ctrl + Shift + P**, search for ‚ÄúPython: Select Interpreter,‚Äù and select your virtual environment.

 Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment  
- Windows:
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Linux/Mac:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

 Step 4: Install Dependencies  
Install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 Step 5: Set Up MongoDB  
1. Install MongoDB and set it up locally or use **MongoDB Atlas**.  
2. Update the MongoDB connection URI in the project‚Äôs configuration file.

 Step 6: Run the Application  
```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Open it in your browser to access the chat.

 üåü Features

- **User Authentication:** Only registered users can access the chat.  
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Instant updates via **SocketIO**.  
- **Group & Individual Chats:** Supports both modes with room management.  
- **File Uploads:** Users can share files directly in chat.  
- **Email Invitations:** Invite users to chat rooms via SMTP email service.  
- **Audio Calling:** Integrated with **Twilio API** for seamless communication.  


üí° Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with **Flask** and **SocketIO**.  
- Built a **client-server architecture** using WebSocket connections.  
- Learned how to **manage stateful interactions** with cookies and sessions.  
- Integrated **authentication, authorization**, and **MongoDB** for user management.  
- Enhanced frontend skills with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
- Worked with **external APIs (SMTP, Twilio)** to add advanced functionality.  


## üéØ How This Project Stands Out  

This project reflects my:  
- Proficiency in Python and backend development.  
- Understanding of real-time systems and socket programming.  
- Ability to integrate APIs and third-party tools into practical applications.  
- Commitment to building scalable, production-ready projects.  

I designed this project to be **relevant to modern real-time communication systems**, showcasing my ability to **build and deploy real-world solutions** that align with current industry trends.  


 üôå Acknowledgements  

- Flask-SocketIO documentation for guidance on WebSocket connections.  
- Twilio API for providing easy-to-use audio calling services.
